utilise geothermal energy on Grande Comore and promote investment in the development of geothermal resources for base power electricity generation. It will do so by leveraging almost $ 46 million in multilateral and private sector financing over its six-year implementation period. Over the same period, a 10 MW geothermal base power plant will be developed to supply the Grande Comore electricity grid to displace diesel fuel that is presently utilised.

Over the same period, 4 small hydropower stations will be developed to supply electricity services to an equal number of villages through mini-grids for income-generating activities and household/community use. Energisation of the villages will result in generation of some 39,770 MWh of electricity over the project timeframe and an annual generation of 14,535 MWh will be sustained over an expected 25-year projected life of the installations. This, in turn, will result in avoiding 35,000 tonnes of CO2 during the 5-year project period and 13,000 tonnes of CO2 thereafter annually over the remaining almost 21-23 years of the equipment useful life.

development in Nauru in accord with the country\u2019s energy roadmap targets. The Government of Nauru (GoN) has set three ambitious energy targets in the Nauru Energy Road Map (NERM) 2014-2020, and following updates, respectively: (1) 24/7 grid electricity supply with minimal interruptions; (2) 50% of grid electricity supplied from Renewable Energy (RE) sources; and (3) 30% improvement in Energy Efficiency (EE) in the residential, commercial and government sectors. So far, the efforts have been focused primarily on achieving the first target, which based largely on technical expertise of the national utility management team requiring very limited financial resources. Currently available technical and financial resources are insufficient to fully achieve all three targets, unless additional support from international donors is made available. SMARTEN will provide the required technical assistance and financial resources and the project design will follow a strategy based on removing all the barriers identified during the Project Information Form (PIF) preparation and successively confirmed during the SMARTEN project proposal preparation. The project is structured into four interrelating Components, respectively: (1) Energy Policy & Regulatory Framework Strengthening; (2) Supporting RE & EE Initiatives; (3) Promotion of RE & EE Technologies Applications; and (4) Improvement of Energy Sector Capacity. All the activities that make these 4 components will be implemented over a 4-year period from 2020 to 2024. The expected duration on several RE & EE technologies installed under SMARTEN will have a lifespan of approximately 25 years, and at the end of this period the cumulative greenhouse gas emission reductions, including expected replication and scale-up projects, is estimated to reach 1.049 million-ton CO2eq.", "genderMarker": null, "donors": [""], "region": "RBAP", "thematics": [], "flagship": null, "hdiTier": "Medium", "incomeGroup": "Upper middle income", "specialGroupings": ["SIDS"], "outputs": [{"outputCategory": "GHG Emissions Reduction", "beneficiaryCategory": "Other", "mwAdded": 0, "energySaved": 0, "policies": 0, "finance": 0, "directBeneficiaries": 0.0, "percentFemale": null, "description": null, "id": "NRU-6188-Other-0"}, {"outputCategory": "GHG Emissions Reduction", "beneficiaryCategory": "Other", "mwAdded": 0, "energySaved": 0, "policies": 0, "finance": 0, "directBeneficiaries": 0.0, "percentFemale": null, "description": "Install renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies in Fiji to achieve the country's energy roadmap targets, including 24/7 grid electricity supply, 50% of grid electricity from renewable sources, and 30% improvement in energy efficiency.

"verticalFunded": true, "description": "Rwanda lost about 64 percent of its natural forests between 1960 and 2007, declining from 659,000 ha to 240,747 ha. Mayaga region harbours 0.14 percent of natural forests and 10 percent of man-made plantations of Rwanda\u2019s total forested area. The 555ha of natural forests and the many and scattered patches of indigenous forests host important biodiversity and carbon stocks and provide critical watershed services to the agricultural landscapes surrounding them.  Forest degradation has taken three pathways in Mayaga: quantitative loss; qualitative loss, and fragmentation, caused largely by encroachment for agriculture and overharvesting of forest products. Adoption of Forest Landscape Restoration as an overarching integrated landscape management strategy is hindered by: a) Inadequate mechanism for inclusive participatory development of knowledge based shared Forest Landscape Restoration objectives; b) Inadequate individual and institutional capacities for Forest Landscape Restoration; c) Inadequate implementation of sustainable land management, sustainable forest management, biodiversity conservation measures and poor uptake of diversified and efficient energy options. The project will provide a coordination mechanism for Forest Landscape Restoration planning and individual, institutional capacities to enable its implementation in four districts (Kamonyi, Ruhango, Nyanza, Gisagara). \nExecuted by the Rwanda Environment Management Agency in partnership with key Ministries, the six year project total cost is US$ 32,706,365 consisting of a GEF Grant of $6,213,538, UNDP Grant of $1,000,000 and Government of Rwanda Co-fin of $25,493,365. It will have three Outcomes: a) Forest restoration plans with institutional and legislation frameworks guiding afforestation, natural resources management and agriculture; b) Individual and institutional capacities enhancement for planning and implementing gender sensitive forest landscape restoration strategies supported by knowledge management; c) Implementation of Forest Landscape Restoration plans secures 555 ha of natural forests, puts 300 ha of forests under participatory forest management, establishes 1,000 ha of plantations under the New Forest Company through co-finance, increases productivity of agriculture and plantation forests on 25,000 ha and 1,000 ha respectively; and reduces wood consumption by at least 25%. The project will deliver four Forest Landscape Restoration plans covering 263,270 ha, leading to avoided emissions of 4,700,825 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in five years and 12,950,839 tons in indirect GHG emissions avoided in 20 years.", "genderMarker": null, "donors": ["GEF + core resources"], "region": "RBA", "thematics": [], "flagship": null, "hdiTier": "Low", "incomeGroup": "Low income", "specialGroupings": ["LLDC", "LDC"], "outputs": [{"outputCategory": "Energy Access", "beneficiaryCategory": "Clean Cooking", "mwAdded": 0, "energySaved": 0, "policies": 0, "finance": 0, "directBeneficiaries": 92020.0, "percentFemale": 49, "description": null, "id": "RWA-5702-CleanCooking-0"}]}, {"id": "6083", "title": "Ecosystems/Landscape approach to climate proof the Rural Settlement Program of Rwanda", "link": "https://pir.pims.undp.org/pir/report?id=38&pirEntryId=4750", "budget": 101455.0, "countryCode": "RWA", "countryName": "Rwanda", "ghgEmissions": null, "verticalFunded": true, "description": "add project description", "genderMarker": null, "donors": ["GEF"], "region": "RBA", "thematics": ["Efficiency"], "flagship": null, "hdiTier": "Low", "incomeGroup": "Low income", "specialGroupings": ["LLDC", "LDC"], "outputs": [{"outputCategory": "Energy Access", "beneficiaryCategory": "Clean Cooking", "mwAdded": 0, "energySaved": 0, "policies": 0, "finance": 0, "directBeneficiaries": 0.0, "percentFemale": 30, "description": null, "id": "RWA-6083-CleanCooking-0"}]}, {"id": "112808", "title": "Poverty Environment Action for SDGs", "link": "https://undp-my.sharepoint.com/query?q=pea&searchScope=all&id=%2Fpersonal%2Fpierre%5Fndindiyaho%5Fundp%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FPEA%5FFinal%20Report%2Epdf&parentview=7", "budget": 112808.0, "countryCode": "RWA", "countryName": "Rwanda", "ghgEmissions": null, "verticalFunded": false, "description": "add project description", "genderMarker": null, "donors": ["Belgium", " Sida"], "region": "RBA", "thematics": ["Just"], "flagship": null, "hdiTier": "Low", "incomeGroup": "Low income", "specialGroupings": ["LLDC", "LDC"], "outputs": [{"outputCategory": "Energy Access", "beneficiaryCategory": "Transport", "mwAdded": 0, "energySaved": 0, "policies": 0, "finance": 0, "directBeneficiaries": 80.0, "percentFemale": 60, "description": null, "id": "RWA-112808-Transport-0"}]}, {"id": "116275", "title": "Strengthening Capacities of the ENR Sector for Green Economy Transformation (SCENR)", "link": "https://erc.undp.org/evaluation/documents/download/21990", "budget": 116275.0, "countryCode": "RWA", "countryName": "Rwanda", "ghgEmissions": null, "verticalFunded": false, "description": "add project description", "genderMarker": null, "donors": ["UNDP Core resources"], "region": "RBA", "thematics": ["Efficiency"], "flagship": null, "hdiTier": "Low", "incomeGroup": "Low income", "specialGroupings": ["LLDC", "LDC"], "outputs": [{"outputCategory": "Energy Access", "beneficiaryCategory": "Clean Electricity", "mwAdded": 0, "energySaved": 0, "policies": 0, "finance": 0, "directBeneficiaries": 4305.68, "percentFemale": 38, "description": null, "id": "RWA-116275-CleanElectricity-0"}, {"outputCategory": "Other", "beneficiaryCategory": "Other", "mwAdded": 0, "energySaved": 0, "policies": 0, "finance": 0, "directBeneficiaries": 0.0, "percentFemale": 65, "description": null, "id": "RWA-116275-Other-1"}]}, {"id": "126434", "title": "Accelerating Clean Energy Access to Reduce Inequality (ACCESS)", "link": "http://open.undp.org/projects/00126434", "budget": 15028509.0, "countryCode": "IDN", "countryName": "Indonesia", "ghgEmissions": null, "verticalFunded": false, "description": "Accelerating Clean Energy Access to Reduce Inequality (ACCESS) aims to support equitable and sustainable access to basic services for livelihood improvements", "genderMarker": null, "donors": ["KOREA INTERN.

primary energy requirements met from imported fossil fuels, Mauritius, like many Small Island Developing States (SIDS), is extremely vulnerable to energy shocks. The grid emission factor of Mauritius is extremely high at 1.01 tonnes CO2/MWh due to the prevalence of imported coal (39%) and fuel oil (38%) in the electricity generation mix. Net greenhouse gas emissions are increasing at a rapid rate of 3% per year. The pressing need to significantly enhance Mauritius\u2019s energy independence and reduce greenhouse gas emissions is recognised in the country\u2019s Nationally Determined Contribution (2016), its Second National Communication to the UNFCCC (2010) and its UNFCCC Technology Needs Assessment (2014), as well as in a comprehensive suite of Government strategies and policies contained in the Long-Term Energy Strategy (2011-2025). \nFollowing a broad consultative process led by the NDA and backed by sound technical and financial analysis as well as cosiderable political will, this project will remove the principal bottlenecks to investment in low-carbon development for: (i) grid-connected intermittent renewable energy; and (ii) mini-grid PV for the principal outer island, Agalega. The project will be implemented in a two-phase approach so as to reduce the implementation risks to the GCF and ensure that the second funding disbursement is contingent upon successful completion of the first phase. \nThe project seeks a total of USD 28.21 million of GCF grant resources, split across phase 1 (USD 12 million) and phase 2 (USD 16.21 million), to overcome identified barriers to low-carbon investment. The incremental logic of the project and its requirement for grant resources are clearly laid out in the proposal. Overall, the project will result in a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 4.27 million tCO2e over the lifetimes of the investments enabled, at a cost to the GCF of just USD 6.6/tCO2e.",
