Through selected Responsible Partners, energy-efficient charcoal kilns, briquetting machines and efficient stoves will be transferred to rural and peri-urban beneficiaries, thereby adding value along the chain while creating opportunities for income and job creation. Environmental benefits are attained by mitigation of baseline greenhouse gas emissions, reduction of local pollution, and saving of forest-based biomass resources. The Project will deliver key elements for building and financing a sustainable charcoal sector, including a policy white paper and sustainability criteria and verification mechanisms. The Project will further build relevant human resources at all levels for implementing and sustaining low-emission development strategies in Angola, with a focus on charcoal and rural biomass utilization.

5569,94483,FREAGER,"Brief project description: PNG’s greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction efforts to date have focused on the forestry sector. Yet, despite low per capita energy use at present, with only 15 percent of the population having access to electricity, the adoption of renewable energy (RE) and energy efficiency (EE) technologies in PNG has strong potential both to reduce current GHG emissions and avoid future, growing GHG emissions expected as rising per capita energy use and electrification accompany development of the nation. Analysis shows that community RE mini-grid and township diesel center based EE programs present particularly compelling win-win propositions for PNG. Over time, both will present substantial cost savings over the business-as-usual case, in which diesel is used, while at the same time lowering present or avoiding future GHG emissions. FREAGER will demonstrate the relevant technologies for and aim to achieve widespread replication of micro/mini-hydro mini-grids, solar PV mini-grids, and township EE programs. It will aim to do so by removing barriers to these technologies in the areas of policy and planning, technical and commercial viability, availability of financing, and information and awareness. In the policy and planning area, the project will promote these technologies via: capacity building programs for officials, through which the officials develop actual pipeline RE mini-grid projects and township EE programs; design of policy incentives; standards work; national roadmaps for community RE mini-grids and township EE programs; and provincial level RE and EE plans. Technical and commercial viability will be supported through capacity building for technical personnel on RE mini-grids and on building and industrial EE. It will also be supported through developing and disseminating information on best international sourcing channels for EE and RE and on the “honest,” best costing for community RE mini-grids in PNG. Project demos will include two mini-hydro mini-grids and one PV mini-grid, with support also provided for productive use of RE at all three sites. In addition, demos of comprehensive EE programs (including building and industrial energy audits and retrofits, support for residential customers, support for future, large power customers, and street lighting retrofits) will be developed in two townships that are fully powered by diesel. The project will also support demonstration of PPAs and billing systems, as well as O&M training, for two mini-hydro projects that are already under development. Efforts related to financing EE and RE will include capacity building for the financial sector and the set-up of an ESCO fund to finance EE retrofits and a loan fund for community RE projects. Information and awareness work will include support to develop domestic manufacturing of RE mini-grid and EE products (and thus achieve lower cots) and briefings on the cost competitiveness of RE and EE as compared to diesel. It will further include a multi-channel media campaign for RE and EE and educational materials on RE and EE. It will also include RE mini-grid how-to handbooks tailored to PNG, pipeline RE mini-grid project listings, data from RE resource assessments, and curriculum from various project workshops, all available at a one-stop-shop website on RE and EE in PNG.",Papua New Guinea,RBAP,"UNDP, GEF",Y,Energy Efficiency,2840640,,,,,159365,,,,,https://open.undp.org/projects/00094483,0
