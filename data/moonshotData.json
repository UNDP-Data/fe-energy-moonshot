Knowledge management and capacity building will be anchored in national host institutions including University of Technology and the Heart Trust respectively covering academic curricula and research, and vocational training.\nThe Project will deliver global environmental benefits (GHG reductions) by replacement of fossil fuel for vehicle transport, by electricity partly generated from renewable energy sources. It further seeks to deliver social and economic benefits through reduction of operational costs, improved service quality, and increased access to transport services for low-income commuter groups in which females are predominant.",

        "description": "This project aims to formulate a conducive policy/regulatory framework to develop and utilise geothermal energy on Grande Comore and promote investment in the development of geothermal resources for base power electricity generation. It will do so by leveraging almost $ 46 million in multilateral and private sector financing over its six-year implementation period. Over the same period, a 10 MW geothermal base power plant will be developed to supply the Grande Comore electricity grid to displace diesel fuel that is presently utilised. Operation of the geothermal plant will result in generation of some 2,390,000 MWh of electricity over an expected 30-year projected life of the installation. This, in turn, will result in avoiding 1,882,125 tonnes of CO2 over the same 30-year projected lifetime of the equipment. The project will achieve this target by introducing a conducive framework for investment promotion in geothermal resources development on Grande Comore.",

The project combines demonstration and investment in integrated waste treatment/management and biogas plants in agro-processing industries and municipalities (including biogas-based, on-grid electricity generation) with institutional strengthening, capacity building for improved waste management, and an improved regulatory framework so that interventions are sustainable and can be replicated in other municipalities and across the agro-processing industry. The Lifetime tonnes of CO2eq reduced from renewable electricity production is expected to be 223,000 tonnes of CO2eq and from methane reduction the GHG emission reductions are estimated at 1,542,000 tonnes CO2eq over the lifetime of investments \u2013 yielding a total reduction of 1,765,000 tonnes of CO2eq.",

It will do so by leveraging almost $ 16.7 million in multilateral and private sector financing over its five-year implementation period. Over the same period, 4 small hydropower stations will be developed to supply electricity services to an equal number of villages through mini-grids for income-generating activities and household/community use. Energisation of the villages will result in generation of some 39,770 MWh of electricity over the project timeframe and an annual generation of 14,535 MWh will be sustained over an expected 25-year projected life of the installations. This, in turn, will result in avoiding 35,000 tonnes of CO2 during the 5-year project period and 13,000 tonnes of CO2 thereafter annually over the remaining almost 21-23 years of the equipment useful life. Finally, over the 25-year projected lifetime of the equipment, 327,250 tonnes of CO2 will be avoided.",

These include buildings of government (central and local) ministries/departments, quasi-government organizations and associations whose operating budget comes from the Chinese government. To facilitate the widespread practice and application of energy conservation and energy efficiency (EC&EE) in the public sector, the National Government Offices Administration (NGOA) established its Energy Conservation Management Division (ECMD) in 2010, making it responsible for advancing, guiding, coordinating and supervising the implementation of EC&EE initiatives in the public sector in China. It has issued a number of administrative actions on EC&EE in the public sector during the 12th Five-Year Plan (12th FYP) period and has so far realized modest achievements. Even though the public sector in China has realized some achievements in EC&EE and in the application of low carbon technologies, energy utilization efficiency and reduction in specific energy consumption in the public sector can be further improved in the coming 13th FYP periods. This existing situation can be greatly improved through improving barriers, including: integrating policy and regulatory frameworks, evaluations systems, market-oriented financing mechanism, and improved outreach and professional capacity building.",

It has been organized into five outcomes:\n1)\tEnabling framework for a green sustainable city enhances integrated urban planning of the AMA;\n2)\tSustainable mobility and transport in the AMA for reducing GHG emissions from urban transport;\n3)\tImproved chemicals and waste management system for reducing emissions of UPOPs, GHGs and toxic chemicals; \n4)\tEmplacing and improving Protected Area management;\n5)\tDissemination of Lessons-learned, monitoring & evaluation\nTo achieve the stated objective, the project will place Asuncion and its metropolitan area on a pathway towards a sustainable and resilient city through addressing the principal current urban problems; notably transport, solid waste disposal, and management of green areas. The project will implement a framework that attends to these issues in a systematic and integrated manner, thus providing a critical step forward to improve the city\u2019s sustainability.\nThis will be done through integrating sectorial planning and defining short, medium and long term goals; developing capacities for their implementation and long term funding needs, and setting up monitoring systems needed to guide and adapt plans over time; thereby promoting a more coherent and integrated vision for the future of Asunci\u00f3n, in which common goals govern policy, planning and investment decisions. Furthermore, it will undertake on the ground action to address the identified problems and delivering solutions to global environment problems. This includes improving the transport and management of municipal and hazardous waste management to reduce GHG and chemicals releases; and improve the management of green areas to conserve global biodiversity values and provide ecosystem services that contribute to GHG reduction and health related benefits; exploring cross-sectorial benefits and providing important inputs and guidance to the broader framework for a sustainable and resilient city.\nExpected global environmental benefits to be accrued include: a) 1,227,442 tCO2e emissions mitigated and sequestered through transport oriented development, green infrastructure and solid waste management policy uptake; b) 13.2 gTEQ UPOP emissions reduced through an integrated waste and chemical management system; and c) increase in 1% of global populations (number of individuals) of 5 species found seasonally at site:- Buff-breasted Sandpiper (Tryngites subruficollis); American Golden Plover (Pluvialis dominica); Lesser Yellowlegs (Tringa flavipes); White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis); and Pectoral Sandpiper (Calidris melanotos).",

To this purpose, the Project will strengthen the institutional and legal framework for low-emission mobility solutions (including the Bus Rapid Transit SITRAMSS) and implement a trust fund for EE investment in the public sector (FIDEnergetica). It will develop technical standards and quality criteria as input for regulation and the design of demonstration pilots. Capacity building in the field of urban planning is addressed by fostering international partnerships and inter-sectorial working groups. The expected fuel savings (43,666 GJ annually) will benefit approx. 50,000 individuals (m/f: 40%/60%) and translates into fiscal budget savings of US$ 1.27 mln annually. EE measures by municipalities will translate into annual electricity savings (3,776 MWh annually) and budget savings of US$ 640,000. The estimated total GHG emission reductions over a 10-year period are about 67 kton CO2eq (direct) and 195 kton CO2e (post-project).",

This, in turn, is expected to generate direct global benefits of 137,200 tons of CO2 over the same period and 36,850 tons CO2/yr thereafter in avoided greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In addition, in order to ensure the availability of hydro resources for electricity generation (and irrigation for job creation), the project will implement an integrated watershed management approach. It aims at integrating natural resource management with community livelihoods improvement in a sustainable way and within a landscape approach. The project will introduce innovative participative methods of natural resource management, conservation farming and agro-ecology. This will be achieved through watershed level land use planning and implementation of community forests over 6,000 ha, sustainable agricultural land management practices over 10,000 ha, and income generating activities (such as mushrooms, medicinal plants, ecotourism, etc.) for rural communities. This landscape approach will be sustained by a financial mechanism between the private hydroelectricity producers and the upstream communities, based on the maintenance of environmental services (water supply regulation).",

        "description": "Population growth and economic development have led to rapid expansion of cities in Turkmenistan over the past two decades, most notably in the capital city of Ashgabat and the resort zone of Awaza on the Caspian Sea.  This growth has had an increasing negative environmental impact \u2013 resource consumption, waste, local air and water pollution, and emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG).  Ashgabat and Awaza have already embraced some measures to manage this impact.  But there remains much untapped technical potential to decrease the volume and impact of private vehicle traffic in all cities, further expand efficient street lighting, reduce waste and increase recycling, and introduce \u201cgreen\u201d practices to hotels.  \nThe development challenge of the project is to measurably reduce the negative impacts of urban growth in Turkmenistan while also advancing social and economic development goals.  To this end, the project will provide technical assistance, institutional and policy support, organization and development of programs, and promotion of behavioral change, all in conjunction with national priorities and specific needs articulated by the Government.  Measures introduced in Ashgabat and Awaza will yield significant GHG emissions reductions and social benefits in themselves, while also creating a basis for replication elsewhere in Turkmenistan.",

        "description": "The proposed project is aimed at assisting the Government of T\u00fcrkiye to increase the use of wood in T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s Building industry by using new, improved wood technologies, such as CLT (Cross-Laminated Timber) using a three-phased approach to promote scaling up and replication of pilots supported by the project which includes the successful implementation during the project of at least 6 pilot wooden building projects for a total of 8 400m2 floor space leading to an additional 0.58 million m2 of new construction in T\u00fcrkiye coming from wood by 2028 or by 6 years from the project start date. The project focus on removing barriers to promoting improved wood-based technologies by reducing legislative and regulatory barriers (Component 1), removing cost and financial barriers through demonstration projects (Component 2) and removing barriers on unsustainable demand and supply chain by awareness raising and capacity building activities (Component 3). The focus of the project will be on supporting the implementation of CLT in the buildings sector and it is expected that the awareness-raising and capacity-building activities will also lead to an increase of other types of wood use in the building sector, such as structural timber (ST) or Glued Laminated Timber (GLT). The project is positively contributing to achieving to T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s INDC, which gave special importance to increasing energy efficiency in the buildings sector through measures such as reducing the consumption of primary energy sources of new buildings through improved building materials and is also supporting the building sector to be a low carbon economy in line with European regulations on energy in the building sector. During the course of the project, an additional 0.58 million m\u00b2 of construction in T\u00fcrkiye come from wood by 2028. A total of 165,715 tons of direct GHG emissions will be reduced, the reduction of indirect GHG emissions is amounting to 2.4 million tons. The project will positively contribute to SDGs 8, 9, 11, 13 and 15.",

        "description": "The stated objective of this proposed SMARTEN project is to enable the increased applications of feasible RE and EE technologies for supporting socio-economic development in Nauru in accord with the country\u2019s energy roadmap targets. The Government of Nauru (GoN) has set three ambitious energy targets in the Nauru Energy Road Map (NERM) 2014-2020, and following updates, respectively: (1) 24/7 grid electricity supply with minimal interruptions; (2) 50% of grid electricity supplied from Renewable Energy (RE) sources; and (3) 30% improvement in Energy Efficiency (EE) in the residential, commercial and government sectors. So far, the efforts have been focused primarily on achieving the first target, which based largely on technical expertise of the national utility management team requiring very limited financial resources. Currently available technical and financial resources are insufficient to fully achieve all three targets, unless additional support from international donors is made available. SMARTEN will provide the required technical assistance and financial resources and the project design will follow a strategy based on removing all the barriers identified during the Project Information Form (PIF) preparation and successively confirmed during the SMARTEN project proposal preparation. The project is structured into four interrelating Components, respectively: (1) Energy Policy & Regulatory Framework Strengthening; (2) Supporting RE & EE Initiatives; (3) Promotion of RE & EE Technologies Applications; and (4) Improvement of Energy Sector Capacity. All the activities that make these 4 components will be implemented over a 4-year period from 2020 to 2024. The expected duration on several RE & EE technologies installed under SMARTEN will have a lifespan of approximately 25 years, and at the end of this period the cumulative greenhouse gas emission reductions, including expected replication and scale-up projects, is estimated to reach 1.049 million-ton CO2eq.",

        "description": "Rwanda lost about 64 percent of its natural forests between 1960 and 2007, declining from 659,000 ha to 240,747 ha. Mayaga region harbours 0.14 percent of natural forests and 10 percent of man-made plantations of Rwanda\u2019s total forested area. The 555ha of natural forests and the many and scattered patches of indigenous forests host important biodiversity and carbon stocks and provide critical watershed services to the agricultural landscapes surrounding them.  Forest degradation has taken three pathways in Mayaga: quantitative loss; qualitative loss, and fragmentation, caused largely by encroachment for agriculture and overharvesting of forest products. Adoption of Forest Landscape Restoration as an overarching integrated landscape management strategy is hindered by: a) Inadequate mechanism for inclusive participatory development of knowledge based shared Forest Landscape Restoration objectives; b) Inadequate individual and institutional capacities for Forest Landscape Restoration; c) Inadequate implementation of sustainable land management, sustainable forest management, biodiversity conservation measures and poor uptake of diversified and efficient energy options. The project will provide a coordination mechanism for Forest Landscape Restoration planning and individual, institutional capacities to enable its implementation in four districts (Kamonyi, Ruhango, Nyanza, Gisagara). \nExecuted by the Rwanda Environment Management Agency in partnership with key Ministries, the six year project total cost is US$ 32,706,365 consisting of a GEF Grant of $6,213,538, UNDP Grant of $1,000,000 and Government of Rwanda Co-fin of $25,493,365. It will have three Outcomes: a) Forest restoration plans with institutional and legislation frameworks guiding afforestation, natural resources management and agriculture; b) Individual and institutional capacities enhancement for planning and implementing gender sensitive forest landscape restoration strategies supported by knowledge management; c) Implementation of Forest Landscape Restoration plans secures 555 ha of natural forests, puts 300 ha of forests under participatory forest management, establishes 1,000 ha of plantations under the New Forest Company through co-finance, increases productivity of agriculture and plantation forests on 25,000 ha and 1,000 ha respectively; and reduces wood consumption by at least 25%. The project will deliver four Forest Landscape Restoration plans covering 263,270 ha, leading to avoided emissions of 4,700,825 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in five years and 12,950,839 tons in indirect GHG emissions avoided in 20 years.",

        "description": "With 84% of its primary energy requirements met from imported fossil fuels, Mauritius, like many Small Island Developing States (SIDS), is extremely vulnerable to energy shocks. The grid emission factor of Mauritius is extremely high at 1.01 tonnes CO2/MWh due to the prevalence of imported coal (39%) and fuel oil (38%) in the electricity generation mix. Net greenhouse gas emissions are increasing at a rapid rate of 3% per year. The pressing need to significantly enhance Mauritius\u2019s energy independence and reduce greenhouse gas emissions is recognised in the country\u2019s Nationally Determined Contribution (2016), its Second National Communication to the UNFCCC (2010) and its UNFCCC Technology Needs Assessment (2014), as well as in a comprehensive suite of Government strategies and policies contained in the Long-Term Energy Strategy (2011-2025). \nFollowing a broad consultative process led by the NDA and backed by sound technical and financial analysis as well as cosiderable political will, this project will remove the principal bottlenecks to investment in low-carbon development for: (i) grid-connected intermittent renewable energy; and (ii) mini-grid PV for the principal outer island, Agalega. The project will be implemented in a two-phase approach so as to reduce the implementation risks to the GCF and ensure that the second funding disbursement is contingent upon successful completion of the first phase. \nThe project seeks a total of USD 28.21 million of GCF grant resources, split across phase 1 (USD 12 million) and phase 2 (USD 16.21 million), to overcome identified barriers to low-carbon investment. The incremental logic of the project and its requirement for grant resources are clearly laid out in the proposal. Overall, the project will result in a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 4.27 million tCO2e over the lifetimes of the investments enabled, at a cost to the GCF of just USD 6.6/tCO2e.",

It has been organized into four substantive outcomes:\n1.1 An updated regulatory and operational framework for sustainable public transport, fostering sustainable mobility and a more resilient urban environment.\n2.1 Enhanced public transport system featuring a Public Bicycle System (PBS) and Transit Oriented Development (TOD).\n2.2 Innovative pilot interventions on low-carbon investments in urban transport validated.\n3.1 Programmatic monitoring of project indicators together with a review of on-going activities to ensure successful project implementation.\nTo achieve the stated objective, the project will place the City of La Havana on a pathway towards a sustainable and climate change resilient city by addressing perennial urban transport challenges. The project will implement a framework that responds to this issue in a systematic and integrated manner, engaging a diverse group of stakeholders including the national authorities (MINCEX and MITRANS),  primarily interested in achieving the project\u2019s overarching development objective by accomplishing the necessary institutional and regulatory reforms and public transport quality improvements, the provincial stakeholders (DGTPH and DPPF), interested in creating the basis for an alternative urban transport system for the city, associated with the design of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system as well as reporting the environmental benefits to the GEF; technological and academic stakeholders (CUBAENERGIA, CIMAB, CUJAE, FLACSO and Project Enterprises), supporting the methodologies for MRV urban transport and integrating urban planning and design; City Transport Operators engaged in the quality of public transport provision; and CSO stakeholders (FMC, FEU and UNAICC) committed to gender mainstreaming, aging population challenges and the cultural change needed for sustainable urban mobility (TOD measures) and Non-Motorized Transport (PBS), thus providing a critical step forward to improve the city\u2019s sustainability.\n\nIt is expected that the project will provide global environmental benefits in terms of direct emission savings of at least 69,242 tCO2eq in 4 years as well as consequential savings of at least 326,536 tCO2eq in the 10 years after the project completion. Total lifetime direct and consequential GHG emissions avoided: 395,778 tCO2eq.",

It will also promote an integrated approach towards fostering sustainable land management that balances environmental management with energy and development needs. It will do so by leveraging significant private sector investment over its five-year implementation period to initially pilot 4 biomass gasifier installations having a total installed capacity of 4 MW. Over the project period, the 4 pilots scheduled for implementation will generate a total of 76,651 MWh of electricity. Moving forward, these 4 pilots will have an annual generation of 24,498 MWh that would be sustained over an expected 15-year projected life of the gasifiers, resulting in the cumulative avoidance of 329,981 tCO2. When activities related to sustainable forest and land management are factored in, a total of 1,094,253 tCO2 will be avoided over the 15-year gasifier lifetime, translating into a unit abatement cost of $ 3.50 of GEF funds per tCO2 reduced.",

It will strengthen these capacities in order to enable stakeholders to integrate climate risks in energy planning and to face climate risks, so that risks of economic losses due to climate change are reduced.\n\nThe goal of the second intervention is to support the development of new frameworks for energy policies and strategies that will take climate change into consideration. Climate change issues and adaptation measures should be integrated into policies and strategies both at the national scale, and in vulnerable areas identified by the NAPA.\n\nThe third intervention will take action to reduce climate vulnerability of energy supply sources in Benin. It will focus on the resilience of watersheds, of forest areas supplying wood for energy, and of electricity production and distribution facilities. It will assess the vulnerability of these areas and take protective measures, involving all stakeholders, to protect these energy sources. Moreover, it will support the development of alternative energy production sources for vulnerable communities.",

Structural environment and finance policy reforms will be tested in the GAM where the greening of the transportation, industrial, manufacturing, and service sectors and improvements in solid waste and wastewater management, will be conducive to the delivering global environmental benefits. Habitat for biodiversity of global importance, including migratory bird and  endangered species, will be improved by consolidating interurban biological corridors (IUBC) that serve as zones of connectivity between key biodiversity areas (KBAs) and as conservation buffers for streams and rivers flowing through the GAM into these areas of high biodiversity value. The establishment of long-lasting private-public partnerships (PPPs) in the GAM will provide the resources needed to ensure the sustainability of project outcomes. Finally, a knowledge management strategy will serve to systematize and disseminate best practices and lessons learned allowing for for replication and scaling-up in Costa Rica and internationally. Central to the proposed project strategy will be the active participation of relevant public and private stakeholders and civil society organizations (CSOs), and promoting gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment through project activities.",

Based on an in-depth analysis of the existing legal and economic barriers, the project will propose reforms in the regulatory, technical, operational and economic framework to foster the use of electric vehicles in public and private passenger transportation, and will introduce various electric public buses and three-wheeler taxis (means of transport popular in certain urban areas in Peru) in two pilot cities, putting the mobility of vulnerable urban groups at the center of the project.\nThe project will also provide a strategy for the uptake of the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) approach to end-of-life vehicle management, including batteries and other electric vehicle components, as well as appropriate finance schemes and business models. It will encourage private sector participation and investments, in the widespread deployment and commercialization of low carbon transport systems, to generate GHG emissions reduction schemes not limited to the implementation of public subsidies and improving air quality.",

In line with UNDP\u2019s Derisking Renewable Energy Investment approach, the project consists of three inter-linked components dealing with policy derisking, financial derisking and incentives, and a fourth cross-cutting component that addresses knowledge-related gaps. The first component addresses policy barriers faced by Green Energy (GE) enterprises/SMEs by supporting the development and implementation of the enabling policy framework. Under the second component, in partnership with local and international financial institutions, the project facilitates access to GE finance at affordable terms. The third component focuses on the supply chain to develop and improve GE products and services and bring them to the market, including through the provision of targeted investment support to innovative and scalable business models for GE products/service delivery in off-grid rural areas. Under the fourth component, knowledge gaps are addressed on both the supply and demand side of the market.",
